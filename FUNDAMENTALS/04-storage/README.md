# 💾 Module 4: Storage - EBS, EFS, and Instance Store

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand EBS, EFS, and Instance Store differences
- Learn storage performance characteristics
- Master multi-cloud storage equivalents
- Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies

## 🏗️ AWS Storage Architecture

### Block Storage (EBS) - The Virtual Hard Drive
**Analogy**: External USB hard drive attached to your computer
- **Persistence**: Survives instance termination
- **Performance**: IOPS and throughput configurable
- **Use Cases**: Boot volumes, databases, applications

### File Storage (EFS) - The Network File Share
**Analogy**: Corporate network drive accessible by multiple computers
- **Persistence**: Independent of instances
- **Performance**: Scales automatically
- **Use Cases**: Web content, shared datasets, container storage

### Instance Store - The Temporary Scratch Disk
**Analogy**: Computer's RAM - fast but temporary
- **Persistence**: Lost on instance stop/termination
- **Performance**: Very high, physically attached
- **Use Cases**: Cache, temporary files, swap space
